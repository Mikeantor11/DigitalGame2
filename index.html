<h2>Kitten Clicker</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Give the kittens your love for as long as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel in a state of panic trying to manage their resources.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A mindless survival game in resource management.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player needs to click the heart in order to get hearts, they can then spend their hearts on items that generate hearts passivly. They then need to spend their hearts on the kittens to make sure that they feel loved.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I am testing resource management in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The process of having to click to get your resources allows the player to work to try and pay for what they need too in order not to die, but also having the ability to invest into resource gainers creates a unique experience for the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You need to build up as much love as you can on valentines day by buying flowers and chocolate; and then give this love to the kittens in the box.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no real story in this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The casual gamer who has a bit of free time and want mindless entertainment.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This game last as long as the player is able to, due to the fact that I personaly did not spend an extremely large amount of time on tweaking the numbers once you reach a certain point you can last almost forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy is to just click as fast as you can and then buy either a card or a box of chocolates. You are better off avoiding buying cheap items as they increase your hearts very fast and do not increase the amount of hearts needed to be played very fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I developed the buttons by myself, found the pictures of kittens off of Google, and the heart off of the OpenArt website.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game resembles cookie clicker!
