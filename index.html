<h2>Police Finder</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get to the Magnifying Glass!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Feel a sense of minor frustration due to the fact that they can't see all of the platforms
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player needs to jump up the stage to reach the magnifying glass!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To test how the user will react to not knowing where the platforms are
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The fact that the first few platforms are visable helps the user know what to do, however since they disapear it is difficult for them to figure out where to go next. Also if the player stays on a plateform to long they will fall right through!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a police officer working on investigating what is going on! The Magnifying Glass will guide you along!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no real story in this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Gamers that enjoy a challenging yet fair game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
About 5-10 minutes depending on the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy is to actually use the platform walls to ride up a platform, you should hold up for most of the game!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I developed all of the art except for the police man, this was from the sprite database.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any platformer, it resembles I Wanna Be the Boshy with how you can't see all of the platforms all of the time.
