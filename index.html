<h2>Dog Catcher</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Try to catch as many balls as you can without falling.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should have an experience where they always feel like they are so close to the next level, but never at their limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
It is a survival game based on some skill and some Randomness.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can move left and right, jump once each time a ball is picked up, and reset the game whenever they want. The gravity is increased slightly every 5 balls (or 50 points), this allows for the game to increase in skill intensity as you progress.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I am testing the concept of deficulty of a game evolving in real time as you progress.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The single jumping mechanic allows for the player to manage a single resource in real time. Where the increased gravity gives the player less time to thing and respond. These two mechanics together create an unique play experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The main chacracter is a dog enjoying a day at the park. The main character is a dog who would like to catch as many balls as he can before eventually getting tired and falling.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no real story in this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The casual gamer who has a bit of free time and wants to try to challenge themselves.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
One game can last any where from 4 seconds to probably about 30 seconds (My Personal Best is only 15 seconds however). Although in the right hands it could go for minutes I suppose.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Due to a bug in the way Phaser calculates collision, the best strategy is to actually make contact with the balls from the side, rather than with the top of the dog. Usally it is best to stay around the middle of the screen (right about the tree).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I developed the back ground and the falling balls myself. The lava and dog resources were found at OpenGameArt.org . The background music was made my a frined of mine.<br>Wolf: http://opengameart.org/content/lpc-wolf-animation<br>Lava: http://opengameart.org/content/seamless-lava-texture<br>Background Music: https://soundcloud.com/the_experimenter
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game resembles the same concept of Tetris where the falling becomes more rapid the longer you play.
